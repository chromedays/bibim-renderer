# What's not gone well
- Vulkan requires way too much code to write
  - This decreased readability of the codebase
- Lack of comments
  - Usually code speaks itself
  - But Vulkan code.. is too verbose to speak itself
- Didn't make enough time to polish the result
  - Need to setup proper scene that shows implemented features
  - Need to visualize more debug data
- Didn't consider enough about the cost of debugging
